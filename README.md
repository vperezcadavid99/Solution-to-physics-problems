**1. Particle Motion in Two Dimensions in a Simple Non-Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator Potential**

This project explores the motion of a particle in a two-dimensional space within a simple harmonic oscillator in a potential. Unlike isotropic systems, where the potential energy is symmetrical in all directions, this oscillator presents a non-isotropic behavior, possibly due to external factors or asymmetrical conditions. The analysis includes studying the particle's trajectory.

**2. Brachistochrone Curve Problem**

In this project, we delve into the fascinating problem of the brachistochrone curve. The brachistochrone curve represents the path between two points along which a particle moves in the shortest time under the influence of gravity, without friction. By employing various mathematical techniques, such as calculus of variations, we seek to determine the optimal curve. Additionally, we visualize the brachistochrone curve.

**3. Symmetry Breaking Verification through Application of Rapidly Oscillating Force**

This project focuses on verifying symmetry breaking phenomena induced by the application of a rapidly oscillating force. Symmetry breaking occurs when a system's equilibrium or symmetrical state is disrupted by external influences, leading to new, often unexpected, configurations. Through numerical simulations, it is possible to investigate how the system responds to the rapidly oscillating force, observing any deviations from its symmetric behavior.
